It keeps good time, has a decent power reserve and the deep blue of the face and bezel is very pretty. The crystal is fairly scratch resistant. Not as good as high end watches, but the hardlex will prevent all but the hardest bangs from leaving a mark. The worst thing about this watch is the bracelet. It feels light and cheap. If you're planning to wear it on an aftermarket strap, as I do, that's not an issue. Though it's a &#34;divers watch&#34; it doesn't have a screw-down crown so it's not really great for doing a lot of underwater wear. That said, I've gone swimming with it on and had no ill effects.","2015-08-31","US","2015"

I am still ambivalent.  This is a good thriller that keeps you guessing at what is REALLY happening.  It is well written. The characters are interesting and challenging to understand.  The plot keeps one turning the pages. BUTâ¦ Is it a great book? No. It reminded me of the movie THE SIXTH SENSE. Once you learn the twist at the end, it becomes an interesting book that never needs to be read again.  A GREAT book can be read several times, each reading adding more to the characters, story, plotting, etc.<br />If you are looking for a quick read that will keep you turning the pages and you can forget immediately after finishing â this is the book for you.<br />3 of 5 stars","2015-08-31","US","2015"

I like the no-nonsense attitude of the main character (Mitch), the fact that his bosses stood by him, the surprises...kind of like the plot led you to believe one thing, twisted away from it then brought you right back to it in the end.<br /><br />I will read the other 12, but I don't think I will read The Survivor...not because Kyle might not be a good writer but because Kyle is not Vince. A book is like a child...no one can replace a biological dad or mum, no matter how much they try.","2015-08-31","US","2015"

Looping it under your armpit leaves the parrot facing oddly towards or away from your head, nothing like the illustration. Putting a stick through the holes in the feet and cutting the strap to allow the parrot to face forwards appears to be the only solution to getting something 'normal'. Not sure why they didn't do that in the first place... Fits nicely on a flat screen monitor or over the arm of an office chair as is though, so depending on your requirements, might be perfect out of the box.","2015-08-31","US","2015"

The hat is a cheaply made plastic thing that was way too big for my head so I  threw it out; gonna go thrift shopping for a better one.

Mitchell (&#34;It Follows&#34;).  But in some ways Matt Reeves has topped then all with this one, at least in part because he was able to get marvelous performances from two adolescent actors, Cody Smit McPhee and Chloe Grace Moretz, for the two main roles of Owen and Abby.  As far as I was concerned, Chloe had already won her wings as a 12-year-old package of trouble in &#34;Kick-ass&#34; and as a startlingly different take on &#34;Carrie&#34; in the remake of that movie, but Smit-McPhee was an unexpected find.  Being Swedish-American, I'd already read John Arvide Lindqvist's novel and saw the Swedish language version of the movie, and I would have sworn that you couldn't transfer it into an American milieu.  But they did, and it succeeds.  As other reviewers have noted, the most vitriolic critics in some cases don't even seem to have seen Reeves's film, instead copying each other's Cliff Notes on why it isn't up to the original (and believe me, I'm usually no fan of re-makes, after seeing how the remakes butchered &#34;Friday the 13th,&#34; &#34;Halloween&#34; and &#34;Nightmare on Elm Street.&#34;)  But this one touched me in a way they usually don't, in that you're sympathetic to the bullied kid who finds a friend to help him strike back, the friend, who herself is trapped in a cage of immortal pain that she can't get out of without final death, the father-figure who has to kill for her so she can keep &#34;living,&#34; the Serb teacher who has enough pain in  his own past to empathize with the kids but knows what Abby is, and the harried policeman who is just trying to bring killers to justice.  Add, on top of that, a sub-plot about school bullying, currently a hot issue,,and it's hard to hate any of them - they're people caught in one of the worst of traps.  This never comes through better than in the scenes between Owen and Abby, who seem to have gone off to a world of their own as adolescents sometimes do, one where they not only can't be understood by adults, they can't be stopped before it all goes too far wrong to fix,and you know that major characters you have grown fond of are going to die.  It's going to take me a while to digest all the implications of this one, but wowser, what a train ride!  A further plus for this edition is the extras, which include a &#34;making of&#34; film (in which Chloe charmingly confesses that sometimes she gets scared by watching her own characters) and some deleted scenes, at least one of which (between Abby and Owen) should probably have been left in.<br />  Conclusion: this is much better than a lot of the critics assumed (but then again, almost every major horror movie in the past fifty years has been initially panned by critics).  Now if they'll just put out a decent CD or Blue-Ray version of the Swedish original so people can see them side by side and make their own judgments. . .rently a hot issue,,and it's hard to hate any of them - they're people caught in one of the worst of traps.

It comfortably establishes Bruce Banner in our world, instead of some quasi-realistic Earth. There's also a thrilling, well-made scene that I'm not going to spoil.<br /><br />That all ends once the Hulkening starts up. The Hulk doesn't look great; he's not the bulky gorilla-bodied weapon of mass destruction as in the Avengers. In this movie, it's almost as if they wanted him to be sexy. He's too lean, and not the proper hue of green. And his haircut is a little ridiculous. He's a giant, green, young Keith Richards, essentially.<br /><br />Beyond those technical problems,the action scenes lack the primal punch that Ruffalo's Hulk has always been able to deliver. Everything is a bit manicured. In one sequence, the Hulk claps really hard to put out a fire. Y'know, because wind or something.<br /><br />Next up, after the initial scenes in Brazil, the film does a pretty bad job of establishing the stakes, and appreciating the scale of the central conflict. And the Betty Ross romance thing isn't pulled off authentically. And the final battle is shoehorned in, and doesn't last nearly long enough for the presentation its given.<br /><br />With all that said, I liked this movie purely because it's not offensively bad. It's just inoffensively mediocre. The missteps it makes are defined by a lacking, not a step in the wrong direction altogether.","2015-08-31","US","2015"

A couple times they would fall off my ring because the band would slip through the opening on the ring snuggie. Since I was using them for my engagement ring until I could get it sized the fact that they sometimes fell off made me way too nervous and I ended up wrapping it in tape so it would be more secure. Still I am giving them three stars because these would be great for everyday fun rings that aren't the right size or you want to wear on a different finger, etc. I just wouldn't wear them with anything that you would be devastated to lose or is very valuable because they are not super secure!

The battlefield scenes reminded me of the realism and gore of the the movie &#34;Saving Private Ryan&#34; directed by the same Spielberg/Hanks duo. Those scenes are hard to watch, but accurately convey the chaos and intensity as well as the random impact of violence on soldiers and marines in battle.  it's good to be reminded of the island-based Pacific campaign which is sometimes overlooked in favor of the land-based European theater in WWII.  This is basically a Marine story.  Among the crowd a few individuals are singled out to personalize the impact of war on families.  By the end of the miniseries these individuals come into sharp focus whereas they tend to get lost in the crowd in the first few episodes.  There are simply too many faces to sort through.  Credits at the end of the miniseries show a few of the actual men and women whose experiences provide the basis for the stories that are told.  Unfortunately issues of race in WWII are entirely ignored in this miniseries - which pretty much reflects how the military (and the nation) functioned at the time.","2015-08-31","US","2015"

He is determined to go straight. He wants as normal a life as possible. However, he can't escape the street. He is unwillingly pulled back into the world that has caused so much heartache. At every turn either a cousin, lawyer friend, or past associates just won't let him go. But no matter what is happening around him or to him he fights for this separation from the street. He finds the love of his life is still available to him if he can finally go straight. Even more incentive for him but he is in quick sand constantly pulling him down and back in.<br /><br />Every actor is superb. Al Pacino leads the way with a truly convincing performance as a man doomed to repeat a life of violence amongst the people he expects  to be most understanding of his desire to go straight. Because he stills lives by a code of the street which is to help your friends he is drawn deeper and deeper back in. You can feel his pain . You are rooting for him to succeed .But that stupid code of his just wont let him detach himself from repeating the same life. He feels trapped but he finally has a plan that will finally set him free and allow him to start over again. Of course he is betrayed and ...... (no spoilers here).<br />The film SCARFACE maybe more violent but it is less cerebral. This is a very intelligently put together screenplay of a man doomed to repeat the same errors no matter how motivated he is to move on.<br />In DOG DAY AFTERNOON he was a good man (confused) forced to do bad. In Carlitos way he is a bad man trying to do good or at least stop being bad. In each case he just can't dig out. His performance is less frenetic here but not less hopeless.HEis doomed by his own values. AL P.screen presence is commanding as he has been in almost all of his career roles. I believe , arguably,  this is his most conviencing role. Here is is a murderer and drug dealer and yet he makes you feel and root for him. That is an amazing talent for you to sympathize with a loser. An evil person. He is not asking for forgiveness but just to be left alone. And you hope he pulls it off.<br />In addition Sean Penns performance is outstanding as a criminal attorney doing what he is hired to do. Get his client off. Except he is a creep. He is not to be trusted. You hate him for what he is doing to his friends. But Carlito feels a strong obligation to the man who found a way to get him out of prison. Theres that code of the street again .He once again crosses over the line of doom<br />And finally his old girlfriend who he never stopped loving and wanting. Does she offer redemption or is she part of the quick sand.<br />The two of them have an amazing attraction that seems to go beyond what you see on the screen. Great chemistry .Great acting ?Just a hunch. ...  This is a tremdous film to watch. I come back to a viewing a couple of times a year when I want to remind myself of great performances.  Whether you are a fan of Al P. or  you just like great performances this is a film not to be missed.","2015-08-31","US","2015"

Or at least I used to be.  After reading the classic works of Clarke, Asimov, Heinlien, Bradbury, and all of the others of the golden age of science fiction, the quality seemed to fall off.  It seems that so many modern authors forget that there is an element of science required for science fiction.  This book seems to reverse this trend.  Mr. Weir has thoroughly researched the science in this book.  It shows.  He uses the science to help tell his story.  I enjoyed this book more than any science fiction work I have read in a number of years.  I hope that the success of this work encourages more technically accurate science fiction.","2015-08-31","US","2015"

Both main and supporting actors are first rate.  The main character, Alicia Florrick, is struggling with some horrendous family problems as she attempts to resume an interrupted law career.  Conflicts between her family life and career serve as a strong theme for the initial season.  Some episodes end in unexpected ways, while some end without a totally satisfying result.  This adds a strong element of realism to the show.  If you're looking for a thought-provoking show that will keep your interest, give this series strong consideration.","2015-08-31","US","2015"

It is technically informed, creative, has a great story line, and dark humor. The story line is so good that I was worried that the author was going to fritz it up, sooner or later. Which doesn't happen. The writing style doesn't have the literary depth of No Country for Old Men, or the colorful biographic language of The Reaper's Line. (We're dealing with an engineer, after all.) And the man-against-planet theme works (without complications of other humans), in a way that reasoning about something other than physics based variables would not have.<br /><br />This is not a blood and guts, man against nature story line. Despite having blood and guts, and an unyielding struggle against nature. It's not The Right Stuff, or Apollo 13. It's more about a small man, creative willpower, dark humor, and grit.

(BTW, I had a nerd moment when I had to smile at the mention of &#34;Wind River Systems&#34;.

I work on wind turbines for a living, and the low setting is great for most times when I need light in a dark area/cabinet/junction box, etc. The dial is much easier and faster to operate than a push button, especially when wearing gloves.  It also comes with a clip that's compatible with Petzl hard hats (which we use), so there's no need to buy an extra headband (or headlamp for that matter).  I can slide this one off my hard hat and onto the soft headband that came with it and get right to work. After pivoting, the light stays secure in that position, and it's ruggedly built. If you use it frequently, it does have a tendency to eat batteries - energizer ultimate lithiums lasted about 2.5 - 3 days of almost continual use.  Other than that, I'm loving this headlamp.","2015-08-31","US","2015"

"52093826","R28Z2FC6F4AC1C","0374533555","366130389","Thinking, Fast and Slow","Books","5","1","1","Y","Required reading for educated people, but falls short as a model of mind","This is an invaluable book that every person who considers him/herself educated should read - even study. Indeed, it is a scandal that mastering the material in this book isn't considered an essential component of a high school education.<br /><br />The author was awarded the Nobel in Economics for his work on what he calls decision theory, or the study of the actual workings of the typical human mind in the evaluation of choices, and the book itself presents the findings of many decades of psychological studies that expose the endemic fallacious thinking that we are all prone to, more or less.  The lives of all of us could be improved by lessons learned from this book, not just individually, through self-education, but also on the large scale, if the large scale decision makers in this society in and out of government could be educated as well.  In fact, it is largely because these large scale decision makers are no better than the rest of us in their ability to think straight and plan well, that society is as screwed up as it is, and that essentially all of its institutions are diseased and corrupt.  The lesson there, however, is that decision making needs to be returned to the individual - that the powers that be need to be deprived of their powers to mess up the lives of the rest of us.<br /><br />Despite the many virtues of this book - it is well-written, engaging, and its academic author reasonably restrained in the tendencies of his tribe to blathering in abstractions - it is a bit disappointing at the very end, when the author proves unable to synthesize all his material into a comprehensive theory of the thinking, and deciding mind - or at least into a set of carefully formulated principles that provide a succinct summary of the principles of human thinking, both typical and ideal.<br /><br />Kahneman uses throughout a construct that implies that we are of two minds: System 1 is the fast-thinking, intuitive, mind, prone to jumping to conclusions; while System 2 is the slow-thinking analytical mind, that is brought into play, if at all, only to critique and validate the conclusions that we have jumped to.  System 2, we are told, is lazy, and if often just rubber-stamps the snap judgements of System 1, or if pressed, rationalize them, instead of digging critically as well as constructively into the complex underpinnings of the material and sorting them out as best it can.<br /><br />Instead of working this construct up into a comprehensive model of mind, K merely uses it as a loose schema for representing the kinds of thinking thought to underlie the results derived from the many psychological experiments that he here reports on.  This neglect raises the question at many points as to just how well the experimenters have really understood the thinking that underlies the behavior of their subjects.  But this, I am sorry to say, is a weakness of virtually all psychological experimentation, which is still just beginning to come to grips with the complexity and varieties of cognitive style of the human mind.<br /><br />What Kahneman does do, however, is to provide convenient labels for many characteristic types of fallacious thinking, although again, the exact role of System 1 and System 2, and their interaction, is inadequately explicated.  Instead, towards the end of the book, another, somehow related, but nominally independent theme is developed: the disturbing divergence between the experiencing self and the remembering self.  This is in itself such an interesting and important idea, so pregnant with both psychological and philosophical implications, that it could have used a fuller treatment, and again, there is no coherent integration of this theme with the System1/System2 construct.<br /><br />The idea here is that our present experience includes our most salient memories of previous experiences - for example the highlights of past vacations, or out of the ordinary episodes of our lives.  Somewhat surprisingly, though, what we remember is a systematic distortion of the actual experience.  Our memory collapse the duration of various aspects of our experience and highlights only the peak moment(s) and the final moments, perhaps with a nod toward the initial presentation of the experience.  And this systematic distortion of the actual experience in all its fullness, can lead us to make irrational and detrimental choices in deciding whether to repeat the experience in the future.  Thus, a bad ending to an otherwise wonderful experience can spoil the whole thing for us in memory, and cause us to avoid similar experiences in the future, even though by simply anticipating and improving the ending we might make the whole experience as wonderful as most of the original was.  Likewise, subjects in experiments involving either long durations of pain, or much shorter episodes of pain with a higher peak, were consistently more averse to the latter rather than the former - or they overemphasized the way these presentations ended as a factor in judging them as a whole.<br /><br />These are important findings that go the heart of the question of how best to steer our course through life, but here is the only attempt at integration of this remembering vs experiencing self theme, and the System 1/ System 2 theme that I find in the final chapter, Conclusions:<br /><br />&#34;The remembering self is a construction of System 2. However, the distinctive features of the way it evaluates episodes and lives are characteristics of our memory. Duration neglect and the peak-end rule originate in System 1 and do not necessarily conform to the values of System 2&#34;.<br /><br />There is more here, but it merely repeats the earlier analysis of the relevant experiments.<br /><br />No evidence is presented as to the respective roles of System 1 and System 2 with respect to the laying down of memory, to its decay, or with respect to a recently discovered phenomenon: memory reconsolidation.  Nor is any account taken of what has been learned, much of it in recent decades, about the interactions between short, intermediate, and long term memory, or any of the radically different modalities of episodic (picture strip) and semantic (organized, abstracted) memory.  Consequently, Kahneman's vague reference to the &#34;characteristics of our memory&#34; is essentially a ducking of the question of what the remembering self is.  I think that at best, the finding of the replacement of the original experience by an abstract predicated on peak-end bias is an exaggeration, though there's no question that &#34;duration neglect&#34; is in operation, and a good thing too, unless K means by &#34;duration neglect&#34; not just the stretches of minimally changing experience (which have little memorial significance anyway, but even the consciousness of how long the edited out parts were (this distinction was never made in Chapter 35, where the theme of the remembering vs. the experiencing self is first taken up).<br /><br />Speaking for myself anyway, I have a much fuller memory of my most important experiences than Kahneman seems to indicate.  Naturally the highlights are featured, but what I tend to remember are representative moments that I took conscious note of at the time, as though making a psychological photograph.  I remember these moments also because I bring them up from time to time when I'm thinking about that experience.  For example, I'm thinking now of a long distance race I did in 2014 (a very tough half-marathon, with almost 2000' of climbing).  I remember: the beginning section as well as the ending section; each of the rest stations; certain moments of each of the major hill climbs; at least one moment from each of the descents; and a number of other happenings during the almost three hour event.  For me in this race, the peak experience occurred right at the end, when I all but collapsed, yet managed to stagger to the finish line.  That ending does naturally come first tomind as a representation of the entire event, but it is merely the culmination of a long and memorable experience with many moving parts, and if I want, my remembering self can still conjure up many other moments, as well as a clear sense of the duration of each of the sections of the course.<br /><br />Over many years most memories fade, and it's certainly reasonable to suppose that in extreme cases, where they are all but forgotten, only a single representative moment might be retained.  However, if we can say anything for sure about memory it is this: we remember what we continue to think of and to use, and we do that precisely because this material has continuing importance to us.  The recent research in memory reconsolidation tells us that when we do bring up memories only occasionally, we reinforce them, but we also edit and modify them to reflect our current perspectives, and sometimes we conflate them with other seemingly related knowledge that we've accrued.  We are thus prone to distort our own original memories over time, in some cases significantly, but we may still retain much more of the original experience that just the peak and the end, and if we do reinterpret our memories in the light of more recent experience, that's not necessarily a bad thing.  In any case, the memories that occur in the present may be said to be a joint project of the experiencing as well as the remembering self, which rather erodes the whole Two Selves concept that Kahneman first posited.<br /><br />I do not mean to criticize the valuable evidential material in the book, and in general I think that Kahneman, and the other researchers and thinkers whom he quotes, have drawn reasonable conclusions from the experiments they report on.  But ultimately, the book, as well as the fields both of psychology and brain neurophysiology suffer both in coherence and meaningfulness because they aren't predicated on a more comprehensive theory of mind.  It's the old story in science, first formulated by Karl Popper in his 1935 book, The Logic of Scientific Discovery: unless we approach the data with an hypothesis in mind - unless, indeed, we seek out data likely to be relevant to a particular hypothesis, we're not going to make any enduring progress in understanding that data in a comprehensively meaningful way, let alone be able to make falsifiable deductions about elements of the system for which we have at present no data.  Popper's quotation from the German philosopher Novalis comes to mind - &#34;Theories are nets: only he who casts will catch.&#34;<br /><br />In the final, &#34;Conclusions&#34;, chapter, K caricatures the abstract economists' model of homo econimicus (man as a rational optimizer of his utility), contrasting it with the more sophisticated and experientially grounded model of psychologists such as himself.  In keeping with his penchant for framing (or spinning) his presentation favorably to his own perspective, he calls the economists' model &#34;Econ&#34;, and his own &#34;Human&#34;.  In fact, &#34;Econ&#34; was never meant to represent man in all his humanity, and Kahneman's Economics Nobel, recognizing his decision theory contributions to economics, was preceded by many other Nobels to economists who had been expanding the concept of the economic actor into psychological territory for decades. In fact, the essential view of the Austrian economists dating from the 1920s (von Mises, Hayek, and their predecessors) is that economics is in the end wholly dependent on psychology because it is predicated on the unknowable, unquantifiable subjective value preferences of humans, acting individually and in concert. Cautious generalizations can perhaps be made about human psychology in general, but I think that on the whole the Austrians have been a bit wiser in their restraint than Kahneman and his many, and mostly lesser, pop psychology compatriots have proved in their often sensationalist extrapolations from lab experiments.<br /><br />Here is an example, I think of Kahneman over-reaching.  He speaks repeatedly of the laziness of System 2, and its foot dragging reluctance to get involved in the thinking process, but in the real world, snap judgements are good enough for immediate purposes, and the better part of rationality may be to go with one's fast thinking intuitive System 1: indeed, Kahneman acknowledges this himself in passing, both in his beginning and his ending, but this isn't enough to counterbalance the overall argument of his book.<br /><br />Kahneman also, in his final chapter, speculatively extends his findings into the political sphere (his liberal Democratic Party bias has already been made clear by gratuitous and somewhat annoying usage of salient modern politicians in examples), but not to any great effect.<br /><br />Kahneman advocates &#34;libertarian paternalism&#34; consisting of government programs that people are enrolled in automatically unless they opt out by checking a box on forms - thus manipulating the presentation frame so as to trick them into signing on to what some government bureaucrat thinks is good for them. Of course, as long as people are allowed to opt out, one can't call the choice here anything but libertarian, though to be consistent with their socialist mores, liberals like Kahneman really ought to object to such practices as being manipulative advertising.  This libertarian finds nothing objectionable about the way such a choice might be presented - after all, the average man, if adequately educated and prepared for the real world, should have no trouble seeing through the frames. What is not only paternalistic, but totalitarian in spirit, is the extortion of taxpayer money to finance such government programs in the first place.<br /><br />Somehow, it fails to occur to Kahneman that most people could be trained to recognize and avoid fallacious thinking during all those years of enforced and mostly wasteful schooling - just as most people can be trained to recognize the M&uuml;ller-Lyer illusion for what it is.  IMO every high school graduate should be required to learn to recognize and avoid the paradigm cases of fallacious thinking presented in Thinking, Fast, and Slow, and this material could profitably be expanded to cover the many rhetorical tricks used by the manipulators and spinmeisters, both public and private, who batten off of our society.  With such training in critical thinking, and with the reintroduction of enough honest and rigor to begin high school graduates up to the 12th grade reading and writing proficiencies that were routine in the 1950s, the need for college as life preparation would be altogether obviated, and most young people could avoid wasting their early years in college, piling up debt, and get on with their work and/or their self-education, as they chose.mind as a representation of the entire event, but it is merely the culmination of a long and memorable experience with many moving parts, and if I want, my remembering self can still conjure up many other moments, as well as a clear sense of the duration of each of the sections of the course.<br /><br />Over many years most memories fade, and it's certainly reasonable to suppose that in extreme cases, where they are all but forgotten, only a single representative moment might be retained.  However, if we can say anything for sure about memory it is this: we remember what we continue to think of and to use, and we do that precisely because this material has continuing importance to us.  The recent research in memory reconsolidation tells us that when we do bring up memories only occasionally, we reinforce them, but we also edit and modify them to reflect our current perspectives, and sometimes we conflate them with other seemingly related knowledge that we've accrued.  We are thus prone to distort our own original memories over time, in some cases significantly, but we may still retain much more of the original experience that just the peak and the end, and if we do reinterpret our memories in the light of more recent experience, that's not necessarily a bad thing.  In any case, the memories that occur in the present may be said to be a joint project of the experiencing as well as the remembering self, which rather erodes the whole Two Selves concept that Kahneman first posited.<br /><br />I do not mean to criticize the valuable evidential material in the book, and in general I think that Kahneman, and the other researchers and thinkers whom he quotes, have drawn reasonable conclusions from the experiments they report on.  But ultimately, the book, as well as the fields both of psychology and brain neurophysiology suffer both in coherence and meaningfulness because they aren't predicated on a more comprehensive theory of mind.  It's the old story in science, first formulated by Karl Popper in his 1935 book, The Logic of Scientific Discovery: unless we approach the data with an hypothesis in mind - unless, indeed, we seek out data likely to be relevant to a particular hypothesis, we're not going to make any enduring progress in understanding that data in a comprehensively meaningful way, let alone be able to make falsifiable deductions about elements of the system for which we have at present no data.  Popper's quotation from the German philosopher Novalis comes to mind - &#34;Theories are nets: only he who casts will catch.&#34;<br /><br />In the final, &#34;Conclusions&#34;, chapter, K caricatures the abstract economists' model of homo econimicus (man as a rational optimizer of his utility), contrasting it with the more sophisticated and experientially grounded model of psychologists such as himself.  In keeping with his penchant for framing (or spinning) his presentation favorably to his own perspective, he calls the economists' model &#34;Econ&#34;, and his own &#34;Human&#34;.  In fact, &#34;Econ&#34; was never meant to represent man in all his humanity, and Kahneman's Economics Nobel, recognizing his decision theory contributions to economics, was preceded by many other Nobels to economists who had been expanding the concept of the economic actor into psychological territory for decades. In fact, the essential view of the Austrian economists dating from the 1920s (von Mises, Hayek, and their predecessors) is that economics is in the end wholly dependent on psychology because it is predicated on the unknowable, unquantifiable subjective value preferences of humans, acting individually and in concert. Cautious generalizations can perhaps be made about human psychology in general, but I think that on the whole the Austrians have been a bit wiser in their restraint than Kahneman and his many, and mostly lesser, pop psychology compatriots have proved in their often sensationalist extrapolations from lab experiments.<br /><br />Here is an example, I think of Kahneman over-reaching.  He speaks repeatedly of the laziness of System 2, and its foot dragging reluctance to get involved in the thinking process, but in the real world, snap judgements are good enough for immediate purposes, and the better part of rationality may be to go with one's fast thinking intuitive System 1: indeed, Kahneman acknowledges this himself in passing, both in his beginning and his ending, but this isn't enough to counterbalance the overall argument of his book.<br /><br />Kahneman also, in his final chapter, speculatively extends his findings into the political sphere (his liberal Democratic Party bias has already been made clear by gratuitous and somewhat annoying usage of salient modern politicians in examples), but not to any great effect.<br /><br />Kahneman advocates &#34;libertarian paternalism&#34; consisting of government programs that people are enrolled in automatically unless they opt out by checking a box on forms - thus manipulating the presentation frame so as to trick them into signing on to what some government bureaucrat thinks is good for them. Of course, as long as people are allowed to opt out, one can't call the choice here anything but libertarian, though to be consistent with their socialist mores, liberals like Kahneman really ought to object to such practices as being manipulative advertising.  This libertarian finds nothing objectionable about the way such a choice might be presented - after all, the average man, if adequately educated and prepared for the real world, should have no trouble seeing through the frames. What is not only paternalistic, but totalitarian in spirit, is the extortion of taxpayer money to finance such government programs in the first place.<br /><br />Somehow, it fails to occur to Kahneman that most people could be trained to recognize and avoid fallacious thinking during all those years of enforced and mostly wasteful schooling - just as most people can be trained to recognize the MÃ¼ller-Lyer illusion for what it is.  IMO every high school graduate should be required to learn to recognize and avoid the paradigm cases of fallacious thinking presented in Thinking, Fast, and Slow, and this material could profitably be expanded to cover the many rhetorical tricks used by the manipulators and spinmeisters, both public and private, who batten off of our society.

Now I know what maade her famous!","COLLEEN HOOVERâS DEBUT NOVEL!<br /> I know what youâre thinkingâ¦<br /> What took me so long to pick up this amazing series by this amazing author?<br /> Honestly, looking back I think I was into reading other books when I first found out about her and just hadnât gotten around to it because of commitments to other books. But Iâve gotten to it now and thatâs the important thing.<br /> Looking at it, after having read all her other books (other than the Never Never series and Maybe Not), I can see why when she wrote Slammed it turned into such a hit. Even though she was writing for the sake of writing because she had all these ideas in her head, thereâs somethingâ¦POETIC that just flows through her words. As they say, when youâve got it youâve got it. Iâm so glad I stumbled upon this amazing author and am excited Iâve finally gotten a chance to read the book that started it all.<br /><br />Layken Cohen has had to endure some big life changes before her senior year of high school. Her father had recently passed away and now her, her mother, and her brother Kel have to move from the home sheâs always known all the way to Michigan. Things seem pretty bleak at first until she meets her neighbour from across the street, William Cooper, who has taken an immediate shine to her. After they go on one date everything seems perfect, and for the first time in months Layken feels happy. But that happiness is suddenly thrown out the window when she finds out the truth about her mysterious neighbour during her first day at her new school. Just when everything had seemed perfect it seems that everything had to fall apart again. Now Layken must face even more challenges than before while trying to juggle this new life and trying not to get her heart broken.<br /><br />At first it was easy to tell that this was Hooverâs first book (after reading all the books that came after). You can see how much an authorâs style and develops after theyâve been at a jobfor so long. But as I previously mentioned, Hooverâs style is very raw, very emotional, and very poetic in its simplicity. Itâs easy to see how she and her books have become such a hit after reading her debut novel.<br /><br />Although there are some points in the book I will say, âReally? Come onâ¦thatâs justâ¦a kick in the face.â like something is so unlikely and yet it happensâ¦it just takes away from the authenticity of the book that it could potentially be a realistic scenario. But thatâs just me, liking books to be somewhat realistic and believable (unless they are sci-fi or fantasy, or even paranormal). Overall, it was a very enjoyable read even though it could beâ¦somewhat frustrating at times.<br /><br />I will say this about Layken.<br /> She is a PERFECTLY, RATIONAL, YOUNG ADULT.<br /> I never found myself struggling or wondering whether or not she was justified by her actions because at that age, with that mentality, yes, I believe she was entitled to feel everything she felt with what was going on around her.<br /> Will Cooperâ¦<br /> Well heâs another story entirely.<br /> I found it a little more difficult to like him in terms of hisâ¦.decision makingâ¦<br /> Overall, I get that he was trying to do the right thing for everyone except himself and was entirely selfless in the matterâ¦but at the same timeâ¦I donât know I felt something off about him. Like he kept giving her the cold shoulder instead of explaining himself properly (which is something a lot of male characters tend to do). I admire Will for his motives, but not the way he carried them out.<br /><br />âThere are three questions every woman should be able to answer yes to before they commit to a man. If you answer no to any of the three questions, run like hell.<br /> âDoes he treat you with respect at all times? Thatâs the first question. The second question is, if he is the exact same person twenty years from now that he is today, would you still want to marry him? And finally, does he inspire to be a better person? You find someone you can answer yes to all three, then youâve found a good man.â<br /><br />Letâs talk about the mood and the tone of the book which really got to me.<br /> This is another book I believe was on the more serious side in terms of content and emotions, but at the same time there were times where I couldnât help but smile. Hoover does this exceptionally well in giving readers a laugh or a smile in between all the raw feelings and the sadness they feel for Layken when relating to her. For once Iâd like to see Hoover try to write a RomCom and see how that goes along; I think I could use it after a serious book or series.<br /><br />Another thing was that I thought it endedâ¦very quickly.<br /> Obviously this was her debut novel so Iâm not going to deduct points butâ¦I donât know again there was just something off about the ending. It wasnât as satisfying and almost felt rushed, like I didnât get to enjoy the revelation Layken had in the end. Anyway thatâs why there are two more books in the series so one can hope for the best! Although from reading the vague and serious summary in the end I doubt itâll be any lighter than this one.<br /><br />4/5 Hearts of Love","2015-08-31","US","2015"

It's a transitional album, the sound of the Brian Jones Stones making way for the Mick Taylor Stones. Jones and Taylor each play relatively minor roles here. Even Taylor's &#34;baptism by fire,&#34; throwing him into the deep end of the pool for the live set &#34;Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out,&#34; has been dwarfed by later live archive stuff like the &#34;Official Bootleg&#34; of &#34;The Brussels Affair&#34; as well as the Leeds, Marquee and Roundhouse concerts accompanying the &#34;deluxe&#34; reissue of &#34;Stick Fingers.&#34; That's where the new band was fully formed, where it became a great, howling, ferocious behemoth unequalled in the history of rock & roll. Consider the famous boast that opens &#34;Ya Ya's&#34;...&#34;The GREATEST rock & roll band in the world, The Rolling Stones...&#34; It's true, you know? The Beatles were a cultural phenomenon that could hardly be contained by the label of &#34;rock band.&#34; The Who were a force of nature, but they were never an &#34;everyman&#34; band unless you felt comfortable inside of Pete Townshend's head, dancing with his demons. No, it was and will always be The Stones...Keef, churning out precise, deliberate machine gun blasts of Chuck Berry riffs, Charlie holding it all together with his trademark bemused / bored stiff expression, Jagger and that rooster strut. I don't think the band fully knew where they were going during the &#34;Let It Bleed&#34; sessions. It was an exploration, a search for something bigger and bolder than what they had in the moment, even though they were kings of their particular hill. Compare &#34;With The Beatles&#34; and &#34;Revolver&#34;...same thing. &#34;Let It Bleed&#34; and what follwed was NOT &#34;better than&#34; anything from the Brian Jones prime years. It was different. It was a band evolving.<br /><br />Obviously,&#34;Gimme Shelter,&#34; &#34;Love In Vain,&#34; &#34;Midnight Rambler,&#34; and &#34;You Can't Always Get What You Want&#34; went on to become &#34;concert staples,&#34; with the &#34;Ya Ya's&#34; version of &#34;Rambler&#34; becoming &#34;definitive,&#34; but as I said above, maybe left in the dust by some of the tougher performances from the Taylor era that finally saw the light of day.<br /><br />For my tastes, Johnny Winter took ownershiop of the title track on his &#34;Still Alive And Well&#34; album. He just tapped a vein of sarcasm, ennui, humor, just SOMETHING that Mick & Keith glossed over by comparison.<br /><br />&#34;You Got The Silver&#34; finally saw a well-deserved rebirth in the &#34;Shine a Light&#34; film, and &#34;Monkey Man&#34; has been trotted out on stage a few times, too.<br /><br />There are NO &#34;disposable&#34; tracks on this one. All nine, all 43 minutes worth, this is as good as it gets. It's history that still rocks, still moves, still inspires.<br /><br />It's as essential as it gets, so...what are ya waiting for?

He then discusses how the ways in which they typically operate and interact can lead to a variety of predictable effects and systematic biases, such as priming, confirmation bias, the halo effect, etc.  In much of this discussion he takes the contents of System 1 as the given, neglecting the fact that what gets automatized is what's done repeatedly by System 2 (though he does pay some attention to this fact later in the book in his discussion of \""intuition\"", which is reliable precisely when based on lots of practice with good feedback in predictable, e.g. high validity, situations).<br /><br />Next he follows Cass Sunstein's distinction between \""econs\"" (basically theoretically rational agents) and \""humans\"" (basically a descriptive rather than prescriptive account of how people actually make economic decisions), arguing that a rational agent model of economic theory is hopelessly flawed and his brand of behavioral economics is more accurate and useful.  While it's true that a model of human action as inherently rational is inadequate, Kahneman swings to the other extreme and seems to delight in trying to show that it is inherently IRrational (even though he half-heartedly denies this toward the end of the book, it's pretty clear where he stands).<br /><br />Finally he draws a third distinction between the \""experiencing self\"" and the \""remembering self\"", trying to show that people's later evaluations by their remembering self aren't consistent with their actual experience.  Again, there's some very interesting material here, such as how the remembering self's tendency to focus not on the sum total of an experience but on particular moments, especially the peak and the ending, explains the narrative structure of our art forms.  But Kahneman neglects that people can legitimately focus on certain aspects of their experience to the detriment or exclusion of others, and this is not at all necessarily irrational or inconsistent.<br /><br />He also notes that even in measures of the well-being of the experiencing self, there is an unequal distribution with some people experiencing life as almost entirely positive while for others it's largely negative, but doesn't know what to make of this and tentatively attributes it to the effects of poverty, disease, etc.  But the real explanation is implicit in (at least a charitable interpretation of) his theory: it's largely a matter of what you choose to focus on, or to put it in his terminology how you use your System 2 (which will in turn improve your System 1 over time, which Kahneman sometimes seems to recognize but at others to deny).  He even goes on to discuss a bit later how victims of debilitating accidents or disease are only made unhappy by it as long as their \""remembering self\"" dwells on it (and as someone who's been dealing with a chronic illness for a decade and had to learn to appreciate all the good in life, I should know!).<br /><br />The main theme I took away from the book is that most of the errors to which people are prone are caused by failing to take the full context into account, or as Kahneman puts it, What You See Is All There Is.  This comes up again and again in his discussions of overconfidence, framing effects, base rate effects, substitution (which is basically being asked for signal and answering with noise), etc.  Whether you want to think of this as differentiating and integrating, zooming in and out, or in Kahneman's terms of narrow vs. broad framing or taking an \""inside\"" vs. (a more statistical) \""outside\"" view of a situation, it all comes down to the same thing, though again he moves from rightfully pointing out the problems of focusing too narrowly on a particular case to the opposite extreme of only considering the broader context and ignoring the particular details of a given case.  This leads him to some disastrous policy recommendations such as relying exclusively on algorithms to make vital decisions in, e.g., healthcare, which could improve outcomes for many people with fairly common or straightforward problems but would result in \""cookie cutter\"" medicine that would pretty much screw patients like me.  I appreciated his discussion of those who reject the use of such algorithms as \""artificial\"", but again he's rejected one side of a false dichotomy and swung to the other.<br /><br />But the book is full of lots of practical tips as well, such as the use of such formulas to maximize predictive validity (e.g. the Apgar score, for more on which read Atul Gawande's [[ASIN:0312427654 Better]]), how to conduct interviews so as to make better hiring decisions, use reference class forecasting to avoid (or at least mitigate) the planning fallacy, use a pre-mortem to overcome the suppression of doubts and overconfidence, see through the endowment effect and avoid committing the sunk cost fallacy, and much, much more, which alone makes it worth reading.<br /><br />This is a fascinating, and frustrating, book.  Kahneman provides a wealth of information, but his explanatory framework is problematic and leads him to draw many blatantly wrong conclusions, even falling into some of the specific wrong thinking methods he discusses throughout the book (notably theory-induced blindness)!  That said, the careful reader can glean substantial value from it.<br /><br />Three and a half stars.osite extreme of only considering the broader context and ignoring the particular details of a given case.

Weâve taken her to UCLA and Stanford, as well as our local hospitals, hoping to make sense of her devastating illness. If you have ever spent anytime visiting a loved one in a mental health treatment facility, I assure you, you would understand that this costume is painfully cruel.<br />Human suffering is not an appropriate inspiration for a Halloween costume. I doubt you would sell a Stage Four Cancer, Holocaust or Slave costume. Why would you sell a costume that makes fun of a severe brain disorder?<br />Stigma only encourages hopelessness and despair. Please reconsider stigmatizing our daughterâs very real illness by removing<br />this costume and other mental illness inspired costumes from your inventory.","2015-08-31","US","2015"

These were EXACTLY what I thought they were going to be and fit even better than I thought because my legs are bigger. I thought I'd have to cut them and add Velcro or something, but turns out I think everything will work out fine. They ARE, however, tight. I measure 16 inches around mid-calf and I measure 18 inches around my thigh 3 inches above my knee. Which is about where it comes to. From bottom to top the boot tops measure 28 inches with the front being a little longer. I don't mind them being tight because I don't think I'll have to find a way to keep them up when I've assembled all of my costume and I'm dressed up.<br /><br />They do bunch up a little bit when I walk, but pull taut when I sit down. I purchased this for $11.06. Because I need wide calf boots it's almost impossible to find anything that fits. I cannot imagine how much it would cost to get thigh high boots. This is a VERY AFFORDABLE solution. I am extremely please with what I've received.<br /><br />There are some creases because they are folded up to ship to you, but again it's costume boot covers and I don't think you can find a cheaper solution. I checked my seams and stitches and I've examined the material. Everything seems to be in perfect order.","2015-08-31","US","2015"

I must have missed something. It is super easy to read and it does flow but I am just very UNDERWHELMED considering the 1,000,000,000 reviews and everyone talking about it. Typically movies aren't as good as the book so since I have read the book no way will I see the movie and no way will I be buying the others in the series.

I liked it a lot and i can't wait to read the rest of the series. I chose to read it because it seemed to be very action-packed, which it was, and also because it was recommended by a lady an Barnes and Noble. I would absolutely recommend this book to a reader who enjoys to read action/adventure books. The book was very exciting and fun to read I just couldn't put it down. This book definitely met my expectations. I was expecting a book that would be very suspenseful and make you feel like I was a character in the book. And that is exactly what it turned out to be. The book exceeded my expectations with flying colors.","2015-08-31","US","2015"

Highly recommended!","Werner Pfennig and his little sister Jutta were orphans; their father was killed in the mine which Werner was destined to work in when he turned fifteen years of age. Living in the Childrenâs Home in Berlin with other orphans and cared for by a kind German woman, their lives were somewhat content. Werner would drag Jutta through the streets in the little cart he'd made, exploring and investigating; forever curious. But the day he discovered an old radio, broken and battered, was the beginning of the love of engineering which would stay with Werner plus change his lifeâs destiny in a way never envisaged.<br /><br />Marie-Laure LeBlanc lived with her father in an apartment in Paris. Papa worked in the museum as keeper of the keys; his daily routine never changed but his love of working with his hands, building miniature pieces, puzzles to be solved, meant Marieâs life was happy and interesting. Until the day when she was only six years old â her unexpected blindness could not be explained. But her papaâs determination that she would be as independent as possible became his lifeâs work. He built a miniature of the neighbourhood he and Marie lived in, and then set about teaching her to find her own way. It took some time; despair of never being able to achieve what papa wanted by Marie; but eventually she was able to navigate the streets with success. But then WWII came to Paris, and the Nazi invasion caused Marie and her papa to flee Parisâ¦<br /><br />Werner was discovered by a Nazi commander; his talent for fixing broken things meant he was needed by the Naziâs â taken from the Childrenâs Home and Jutta and ensconced in a Military Academy which was run by brutal German zealots, the cruelty and fanaticism were a day to day occurrence. But when unexpectedly Werner was removed from the academy, he found himself in the midst of the war. His youth was ignored by his superiors; they needed his expertise.<br /><br />Keeping to themselves, Marie and her papa lived their time quietly in Saint-Malo with Marieâs great uncle Etienne and Madame Manec. Marie once again learned to navigate the house they lived in; but there was change and danger around. What would happen to their future? Would the war; the Nazis reach Saint-Malo?<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed All the Light We Cannot See by Anthony Doerr. A beautifully written, heartfelt rendition of WWII; the innocence of children and that loss of innocence through the heartbreak of war - the poignancy and sadness, hope and love are all there. The unbelievably descriptive words are amazing. The author has an incredible way with words; words that mean so much, explain so much â I almost felt as if I was there. I have no hesitation in highly recommending this wonderful and very special novel.","2015-08-31","US","2015"

There an eighteen year old Nella from an impoverished family arrives as a wife of merchant trader. She agreed to marry this rich merchant due to their reduced financial circumstances. Nevertheless, a spark was there, but the marriage is nothing what Nell imagines. She feels lonely and yearns for her husbandâs love, but instead she receives a harsh-treatment from her brotherâs sharp-tonged sister. However, an event occurs and powers switch at the house. Meanwhile, Nella receives a wedding-gift from her husband â a cabinet-sized replica of their home. She engages the services of a miniaturist to furnish her gift. This also turns into something unexpected.<br /><br />The story has a well-developed plot and characters with unexpected turns, making it an interesting and fast read.

You'll only be disappointed.","When Harper Lee submitted Go Set A Watchman she was encouraged to go back and write about Scout's character as a child instead. Thank God. We never would have had To Kill A Mockingbird and it was so much better than this novel. The character development is no where near as robust âif I hadn't read TKAM, I wouldn't have cared about any of them. Plus, the story line was pretty uneventful. Part of the criteria I use to judge a book is by how often I put it down. I put this one down a lot. I'm guessing it would've never been published had Harper Lee's name not been attached to it. I kind of wish it wasn't.","2015-08-31","US","2015"

Filled with intense Pod Racing, Lightsaber swordplay, and one of the coolest villains in Star Wars since Vader. Phantom Menace is a different experience from the original trilogy because of it's heavy political atmosphere. Many will try to argue that it is a terrible film, mainly because of it's script, which is written to be corny since it is a &#34;Space Opera&#34;. Another is an &#34;overuse of CGI&#34; which is also not true, since their are plenty of models, props, and practical explosions. Lastly there is the character of Jar-Jar Binks, the most hated character for some vague reason. He is the comical relief character, aimed mostly at children, but instead a bunch of 30 year olds think he's not funny and annoying, and find C3P-O in Empire Strikes Back to be absolutely hilarious because he was funny when they were children. This film is not for anybody who still watch the original trilogy on VHS, because they will hate you and start yelling about how their &#34;childhood was ruined&#34;.","2015-08-31","US","2015"
